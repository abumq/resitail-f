# resitail-f

[**This is in early stages of development**]

resitail-f is resitail hook that is aimed to provide a better interface than simple resitail-browser with ability to:

 * Login for clients - so not everyone who is using this interface can see everyone's logs on the server
 * Better interface - where each client is a `channel` hence you can browse and filter logs for the current channel
 * Speed - unlike resitail-browser, resitail-f is aimed to use native javascript in order to access and modify DOM without compromising speed or lag as updating the DOM can be slow at times
